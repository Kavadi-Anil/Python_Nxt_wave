# Python Code Notes

This document explains several Python code snippets. For each one:

- What the code does (in simple terms)
- Sample input
- The code itself
- The output youâ€™d see
- Step-by-step explanation

## 1. Average of a List of Integers

**What does it do?**  
Calculates and prints the average of a list of comma-separated integers entered by the user.

**Sample Input:**
```
1,2,3,4,5
```

**Code:**
```python
x = input()   
L = len(list(map(int, x.split(","))))
print(sum(list(map(int, x.split(",")))) / L)
```

**Output:**
```
3.0
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. `input()` reads a line of text from the user, e.g. `"1,2,3,4,5"`.
2. `x.split(",")` splits the string into a list: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
3. `map(int, x.split(","))` converts each element to an integer: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. `list(...)` ensures it's a list.
5. `L = len(...)` counts how many numbers were entered (`5` in this case).
6. `sum(...)` adds up all the integers (`15`).
7. The average is printed: `15 / 5 = 3.0`.

## 2. Find the Nth Smallest Number

**What does it do?**  
Prints the nth smallest number from a list of comma-separated integers.

**Sample Input:**
```
7,3,2,8,4
3
```

**Code:**
```python
listed = input() 
val = int(input())
got = sorted(list(map(int, listed.split(","))))  
print(got[val-1])
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. User enters a list: `"7,3,2,8,4"`.
2. User enters a value: `3`.
3. The string is split and converted to integers: `[7, 3, 2, 8, 4]`.
4. The list is sorted: `[2, 3, 4, 7, 8]`.
5. `got[val-1]` gets the 3rd (index 2) element: `4`.
6. `print(got[val-1])` outputs `4`.

## 3. Find the Median of Numbers

**What does it do?**  
Calculates and prints the median of a list of comma-separated integers.

**Sample Input:**
```
2,4,1,3,5
```

**Code:**
```python
x = sorted(list(map(int, input().split(","))))
L = len(x)    
if L % 2 == 0: 
    print((x[int((L/2))] + x[int((L/2))-1]) / 2)
else:
    print(x[(L//2)]) 
```

**Output:**
```
3
```
(If input is `2,4,1,3`, output is `2.5`)

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. User enters: `"2,4,1,3,5"`.
2. String is split and numbers are sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
3. `L = len(x)` finds the length.
4. If length is odd, prints the middle element (`3`).
5. If even, prints the average of the two middle elements.

## 4. Smallest Number After Nth Position

**What does it do?**  
Finds and prints the smallest number in a list after the Nth position.

**Sample Input:**
```
5,7,1,4,2
2
```

**Code:**
```python
S = input()
N = int(input()) 
x = list(map(int, S.split(","))) 
maxx = float('inf')
for i in x[N:]: 
    maxx = min(i, maxx)
print(maxx)
```

**Output:**
```
1
```
(The numbers after the second index are `1,4,2`; smallest is `1`.)

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. User inputs: `"5,7,1,4,2"`.
2. User inputs: `2`.
3. List becomes: `[5,7,1,4,2]`.
4. `x[N:]` takes all items from position `N` onward (`[1,4,2]`).
5. Loops through those, finding the minimum.
6. Prints the minimum.

## 5. Sum of the N Smallest Numbers

**What does it do?**  
Calculates and prints the sum of the N smallest numbers from a list.

**Sample Input:**
```
8,3,5,1,6
3
```

**Code:**
```python
s = input() 
N = int(input()) 
x = sorted(list(map(int, s.split(","))))
x = sum(x[:N]) 
print(x)
```

**Output:**
```
9
```
(Smallest 3 are `1,3,5`; sum is `9`.)

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. User inputs: `"8,3,5,1,6"`.
2. User inputs: `3`.
3. List becomes: `[8,3,5,1,6]`.
4. List is sorted: `[1,3,5,6,8]`.
5. `x[:N]` gets the first 3: `[1,3,5]`.
6. `sum(...)` adds them: `9`.
7. Prints the sum.
